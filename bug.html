I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly, even though I had followed all the setup instructions and the classes were correctly imported. The issue was particularly noticeable when using complex responsive designs. Some styles would apply as expected, while others, even with the same class names, wouldn't. The browser's developer tools didn't show any obvious errors, and the Tailwind CSS configuration file appeared to be set up correctly.
